                            I worked on the development of a software tool for the European Space Agency (ESA) to help with the
                            verification of software used in space missions. The tool is based on formal methods and is designed to
                            help engineers verify the correctness of their software.

                            I worked on the development of the FDIR (Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery) system for the
                            TOLOSAT satellite. The system is designed to detect and recover from faults in the satellite's
                            subsystems. I was responsible for the development of the software that implements the FDIR algorithms and
                            the integration of the software with the satellite's hardware.

                            I am currently a student at ENSEEIHT, where I am studying software engineering. I have completed courses in
                            embedded systems, formal methods, and software engineering. I am also a member of the ENSEEIHT robotics
                            club, where I work on the development of software for robots.
